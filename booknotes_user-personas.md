# About Face: Modeling Users   
### Summary   
Personas are a tool based on research that helps us to focus on specific users behavior, needs and goals instead of tribal knowledge, use cases and technology.   
Personas include the whole range of distinctions and similarities of goals, needs and behaviour which helps the team and stakeholder to understand the how to build compelling product.   
People have 3 levels of levels of processing situations. The first one is called Visceral and on this level people’s goals are quite simple and more about how they want to feel, who they want to be. The second level is called Behavioural and effectively it is the most important for the product to be designed for, because the user’s goal is to accomplish something specific. The third level is called Reflective and it is important for user to create a relationship with the product. The goals on this level would be related to life goals or career goals.   
If the experience and end goals are met, the user will be satisfied. Additionally if the life goal is met, the user becomes a fan.   
User goals are motivations to accomplish a task.   
The scenario is based on the research insights related to the identified behavioral pattern.   
Goals are created for each behavioral pattern to show what was leading to this pattern.   
People in the same role may have different needs and motivations.   
Dividing interview into three consecutive phases will allow us to always reflect on the previous one and narrow or expand the scope of interviews.   
Questions shouldn't be fixed, because we have to assume we don't know the domain enough and we need to learn it from the participants by using open-ended questions to gather more details and close ended questions for validating details.    
# **Personas**   
- A persona model is a way of making sense of the research outcomes so anyone can understand it.   
- Models help us visualise and understand various aspects of relationships, needs and goals of users.   
- We use personas for ideating and validating.   
- The process of identifying significant and meaningful patterns in user behaviour is important for an accurate representation of user archetypes.   
- Personas are user archetypes based on research consisting of behaviour patterns to help us ideate and validate product ideas.   
   
## **Use of Personas**   
Personas are a tool based on research that helps us to focus on specific users behaviour, needs and goals instead of tribal knowledge, use cases and technology.   
- Instead of building a wide variety of functionality it is better to design for various types of users with specific needs.   
- By building the wide variety of functionality we may create a cognitive overload for all types of users.   
- In addition to qualitative research the quantified personas can be used for prioritisation of the functionality.   
- Personas are easier to understand because the resemblance to real people   
- By understanding personas the team can ideate, validate and prioritise the functionality to build.   
- The term "user" is not defined and every member of the product team has his own conception of who the user is and what the user needs.   
    - The user can be once a power-user and next a first-time user and by this elasticity can always serve the product team to build what they need to.   
    - User can be anyone who we need it to be to help us build functionality as we want to.   
- Using roles is not ideal either because there never will be enough roles to clarify the user behaviour, needs and goals.   
- Self-referential design is projecting and extending our own goals, behaviour on users. Building the functionality based on our perfect knowledge of the product technology.   
- Edge cases should be known and designed for, but never should be in the focus.   
   
## **Effectiveness of Personas**   
Personas include the whole range of distinctions and similarities of goals, needs and behaviour which helps the team and stakeholder to understand the how to build compelling product.   
- Personas engage the team and help them empathise on user goals.   
- When are personas done the right way it will connect the team and stakeholders and make the work together and the product will be more compelling to users.   
- The quality of research inputs directly impacts the personas efficacy - usefulness.   
- Personas can be informed by other types of input, like market research, analytics, but it can’t substitute the direct user interviews and observations.   
- Personas are “composite user archetypes” because they are made of grouping of various insights and data gathered during the research phase.   
- Personas can not be reused on another products if the environment and domain differs from the one the research sourced the insights.   
- Archetypes are the opposite of stereotypes.   
- Personas should represent ranges of behaviour not averages.   
- Personas represent different clusters of behaviour patterns.   
- Goals are fundamental part of the persona because it is this part which makes the team understand why the user wants to accomplish something.   
- Personas can also represent non-users, like stakeholders, buyers, passive consumers of the service or even people for which the product is not made for.   
- Persona can represent multiple user roles because it is covering distinctions or similarities among users. Role can oversimplify aspects.   
   
## **Goals**   
- Goals are a lens through which designer should see the product functionality. The goal is an end of a task.   
- Goals motivate people to behave as they do.   
- People are not prepared to articulate goals directly so the research needs to reconstruct them from the answers and observation.   
   
### **3 Levels of Cognitive Processing**   
People have 3 levels of levels of processing situations. The first one is called Visceral and on this level people’s goals are quite simple and more about how they want to feel, who they want to be. The second level is called Behavioural and effectively it is the most important for the product to be designed for, because the user’s goal is to accomplish something specific. The third level is called Reflective and it is important for user to create a relationship with the product. The goals on this level would be related to life goals or career goals.   
If the experience and end goals are met, the user will be satisfied. Additionally if the life goal is met, the user becomes a fan.   
User goals are motivations to accomplish a task.   
- Users validate their goals in 3 levels of cognitive processing - visceral (immediate, impulsive), behavioural (during the task, regular), reflective (with a time distance, considering only what he remembers).   
- Those 3 levels resembles to me the 3-act story structure (setup-confrontation-resolution)   
    - But those cognitive levels are parallel   
- Designing for an immediate affect means to consider emotions and feelings appropriate for a specific situation.   
- By the immediate affect design is made a promise for the behavioural processing level and it should be fulfilled.   
- Designing for the behavioural level means to consider the user’s current behaviour, expectations and mental models.   
- Designing for the reflection level is an opportunity for us to build the long-term relationship with the user.   
- The book (and Don Norman) describes it as aesthetic thing, iconic and as examples they use Sony Walkman, iPhone or a Phillips Starck juicer. But I feel that it could be more practical, like that designing in a way that users will be happy about the experience during the task also in the retrospective. Maybe how he wants to be perceived by people.   
- Ok, now it makes all sense - the 3 persona goal types corresponds with the 3 cognitive processing levels.   
- Experience goal (Visceral) - How the user wants to feel (It will be easy be more organised with this tool)   
    - Experience goals are the small things that makes users feel good while using the product. It can be small technical and functional details like **performance, usability and accessibility or a pure delight by a nice design, understandable icons**.   
    - The goals on this level can be - Feel smart and in control or remain focused.   
    - A product that makes people feel uncomfortable will inevitably fail, because it is failing in accomplishing their experience goals.   
- End goal (Behavioural) - What the user wants to do (I can use this tool to prioritise my tasks)   
    - The end goal is a user’s motivation to accomplish a task.   
    - The goals on this level can be - Distribute the work effectively this month or find out why we are not making deadlines.   
- Life goal (Reflective) -Who the user wants to be (Wants to be seen as successful, smart or don’t want to learn new things)   
    - The life goal is an aspiration of the user.   
- If the experience and end goals are met, the user will be satisfied. Additionally if the life goal is met, the user becomes a fan.   
   
## Constructing Personas   
After we conduct the research and organize the data, we will start constructing personas in the 7 steps   
> Steps   

1. Group interviwees by role (for enterprise products this may be already done before)   
2. Identify behavioral variables   
3. Map interview subjects to behavioral variables   
4. Identify significant behavioral patterns   
5. Synthesize characteristics and define goals   
6. Check for completeness and reduncancy   
7. Designate persona types   
8. Expand goals and description   
   
### **Types of Behavioral Attributes (MAAAS)**   
15-30 attributes per role.   
> Types   

- Motivations   
- Activities   
- Attitudes   
- Aptitudes   
- Skills   
- When placing on the behavioral attribute scale it is more important to place similar participants together then placing them to the right position.   
- A significant behavioral pattern means that after mapping the participants on scales we should see clusters on 30-50% of scales.   
- Clusters can't be only correlations but logical or causative. *E.g. People who buy CDs are downloading MP3s more often, compared to People who buy CDs are more likely to be vegetarians.*   
   
### Characteristics and goals   
- Create a Typical day in life scenario for each persona.   
   
The scenario is based on the research insights related to the identified behavioral pattern.   
> The scenario should cover   

- behavioral pattern itself   
- environment and context   
- pain points and frustrations   
- demographics   
- skills, experience needed   
- attitudes and emotions   
- relevant interactions with other people or tools   
- alternate ways of doing the same thing   
   
Goals are created for each behavioral pattern to show what was leading to this pattern.   
- We'll use the insights from the interview and particularly from goal-oriented questions.   
   
> Persona Types   

- Primary - the one for which the interface is build for   
- Secondary - whos goals are fulfilled without obstructing primary persona's interface   
- Supplemental - are satisfied with a combination of primary and secondary personas interface   
- Customer - represents the needs of customers, not end users   
- Served - not user of the interface but directly affected by the outcomes   
   
   
People in the same role may have different needs and motivations.   
# Interviews   
## Interview Phases   
Dividing interview into three consecutive phases will allow us to always reflect on the previous one and narrow or expand the scope of interviews.   
- **Early interviews** are broader and open-ended explorations with less drill-downs.   
- **Middle interviews** should start reveal patterns based on asking open-ended questions with an additional clarifying questions.   
- **Late interviews** should confirm the previously observed patterns and further clarify those by asking more closed-ended questions.   
   
## Questions   
Questions shouldn't be fixed, because we have to assume we don't know the domain enough and we need to learn it from the participants by using open-ended questions to gather more details and close ended questions for validating details.    
- We assume that we don't know enough about the domain to have a set of fixed questions.    
- We have to learn about the domain from the interview subject.   
- We can have a set of topics to cover and questions that will help us gather more details.   
   
> Types of Questions   

**Goals**   
- Goals - What makes a good day for you?   
- Opportunity - What activities currently waste your time?   
- Priorities - What is most important to you?   
- Information - What helps you make decisions?   
   
**System**   
- Function - What are the most common things you do with the product?   
- Frequency - What parts of the product do you use the most?   
- Preference - What are your favorite aspects of the product?   
- Failure - How do you work around problems?   
- Expertise - What shortcuts do you employ?   
   
**Work-Flow**   
- Process - What did you do when you first came in today?   
- Occurence - How often do you do this?   
- Exception - What makes a typical day? What would be an unusual event?   
   
**Attitude**   
- Aspiration - What do you see yourself doing five years from now?   
- Avoidance - What would you prefer not to do? What do you procrastinate on?   
- Motivation - What do you enjoy most about your job? What do you always tackle first?
